# SuperStore_Visualization

I have created a visualization dashboard to get insigths from the dataset and answer the following questions which would help in making business decisions.
* Who are our most profitable customers by segment and region?
* What products are the purchasing and how many?
* When are they purchsing these products?
* Where are my sales and profit coming from?

First chart gives us information about the customer. It shows us who are the most profitable customers in each region(north, south, east, west). Based on this information company can find out who are their most profitable customers and offer some benefits repectively.

Second chart gives us knowledge about the number of products that customer are buying in each segment which is consumer, office supplies and home supplies. And by looking at the visulaization I observed that the maximum number of product sold were in the consumer segment. This information will help to keep the inventory up to date and understand the need of the market.

Third chart gives us information about the time- frame when the products are being sold. From this area chart we can obverse the peak increase in sale at certain quarter which will help companies to increase their production during that period and dig deeper to know what caused this hike in sale during that particular period.

Lastly, the fourth chart tells us which state is giving highest profit and sale. This information can be used by companies to analyse the market before opening any new store.
